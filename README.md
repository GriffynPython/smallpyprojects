# smallpyprojects
These are a list of 10 small python scripts that I have written for cybersecurity users annd for those wanting to find specific file
types on their file system. I invite others to improve and contribute to my project.
File-search Utility: I have created a program that lists the types of files that the user requires by entering the path to the directory that he/she wants 
to acquire the files from. Python module implemented: os.
Simple Port Scanner: I have created a project that checks whether a type of network port is open or not and returns that to the user.
Python module implemented: socket
